# Data Matrix Normalization and Merging Strategies Minimize Batch-specific Systemic Variation in scRNA-Seq Data

This repository is intended to support reproducibility of our recent manuscript: "Data Matrix Normalization and Merging Strategies Minimize Batch-specific Systemic Variation in scRNA-Seq Data." The complete text and supplementary materials of the preprint are made freely available via bioRxiv, accessible [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.18.456898v1)

To enable rapid reproduction of the published figures, we have made a set of pre-assembled Seurat objects available as part of an R packaged "BatchNorm", available on github [here](https://github.com/Ghosn-Lab/BatchNorm).
