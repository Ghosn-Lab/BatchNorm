description: >
  How to determine if pooling samples to sequence simultaneously can improve sequencing? scRNA-Seq libraries from two different donors, sequenced to similar depth (Samples 4-A, 4-B and 5-A) were either sequenced at the same time ("sequenced together" samples 4-A & 5-A) or at different times ("sequenced separately" samples 4-B & 5-A). The full results of this test are described in our published Figure 3.
